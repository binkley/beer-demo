# Beer Demo

Following [Bootiful Development With Spring Boot and React](https://dzone.com/articles/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-react).

_Note_: This project uses Typescript.  It is basically JavaScript with type
annotations.  I find this helps me better understand what data structures 
are for what purposes.  YMMV.
